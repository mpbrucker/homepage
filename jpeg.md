For this project, my team decided to explore a concept that we had already explored in Quantitative Engineering Analysis: sinusoid-based transforms. We wrote our own implementation of JPEG in MATLAB, from scratch.

## The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and JPEG Compression

For the first part of our project, we investigated the properties of the DCT, and its use in implementing JPEG compression. Based on that, we wrote our own implementation of JPEG compression in MATLAB, using a version of the DCT that we wrote. The result, when applied to images, reduces file size while losing some amount of image data.

As part of the project, we also created a website to explain the concepts we explored. You can find our website [here.](https://mpbrucker.github.io/fourier_images/)
