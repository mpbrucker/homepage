## Provocation

**The Greenhouse** is a group independent study I helped start at Olin. Part design lab and part institutional change studio, we work on design projects in collaboration with institutions -- both internal to Olin and external. Over the three semesters of The Greenhouse's existence, I've prototyped several different forms of its visual identity, both virtual and print.
