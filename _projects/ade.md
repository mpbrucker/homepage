## Provocation

Our team, Air Partners, exists to provide information and access to resources for improving the air health of residents in East Boston. In this ongoing project, I worked on a team of seven for a semester, mainly helping to develop and co-design a public awareness poster ad campaign to be deployed in East Boston in 2020. We spent much of the semester the deployment of our campaign as well as getting extensive feedback from East Boston residents and elected officials, in order to align our efforts with the needs of East Bostonians as much as possible.
