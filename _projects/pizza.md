## Provocation

At Olin, "pop-up" spaces and events are fairly common; we wanted to experiment with the hype and demand for pop-up spaces and offer something new: homemade pizza. We proposed our idea to the Student Activities Committee, who funded the project, planning a one-day pizza pop-up serving pizzas to students. The pizza making became a space for congregation as students waited for their pizzas to be cooked one-by-one. In total we made 35 pizzas, selling out in under two hours.
