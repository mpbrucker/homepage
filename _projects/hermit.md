## Provocation

For our final project in Design Nature, I worked on a team of five to design and build a play experience for fourth-grade students, based on a given animal--for our team, hermit crabs. Over the course of seven weeks, we investigated hermit crab behaviors, brainstormed experiences, researched educational standards, and prototyped on our ideas.

Our final design was **Hermit Crab Olympics,** an experience inspired by hermit crabs' shell-switching behaviors. Two full-size foam shells allow fourth-graders to participate in a relay race, using their arms for locomotion in the same manner as hermit crabs, switching shells midway through.
