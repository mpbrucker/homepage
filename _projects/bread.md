## Provocation

National parks are sites of preservation, specially-reserved places guarded from the destruction of industrialization and urbanization--but only for areas deemed noteworthy for their natural beauty. This project explores what areas of everyday life might become sites of spectacular beauty if we were one inch tall. While sourdough bread is made through human intervention, the "cave system" created by its holes and nooks is entirely the work of the naturally-grown yeast within it. I created a to-scale model of what a Sourdough National Park might look like.
