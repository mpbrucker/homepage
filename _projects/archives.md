## Provocation

We spent a semester working with the [WGBH](https://www.wgbh.org/) Archives to create an interactive installation for bringing awareness of the Archives to the broader public. WGBH stores several decades' worth of classic public television shows and broadcasts in its Archives, and is working to make its material more accessible through the [OpenVault](http://openvault.wgbh.org/) and other projects. I worked on a two-person team for a semester to design the installation. After acquiring two vintage television sets, we decided to replicate the experience of watching analog broadcast TV.

### Analog Broadcast

Using repurposed analog broadcast equipment, we set up a short-range broadcast station capable of broadcasting analog or digital content on up to six channels simultaneously. Any analog TV within range will pick up the broadcast without any modification.

### Archives Over the Air

We demonstrated a prototype version of our exhibit, Archives Over the Air, at a WGBH alumni event, showing off our setup with five decades' worth of WGBH archival content set up in a replica '70s-'80s living room.

### Hyperlocal TV

Along with the exhibit, we produced an 8-page zine, **Hyperlocal TV,** explaining our setup and how anyone can start making their own broadcasts. You can download a copy for yourself here: [hyperlocaltv.pdf](/assets/hyperlocaltv.pdf)
