I spent a semester on a team of four doing in-depth collaborative design with a user group. Our team met with ten individuals who work with refugees and immigrants--through community organizations, charities, and in Boston's City Hall--to learn about their work and their pain points. After generating ideas, we brought them back to the same people to co-design interventions that would improve their lives.

We found that people working in this area often struggled to get a "big picture" view of the impact they were having, and a lack of data also sometimes made it difficult to acquire funding.

At the same time, they cared greatly about their work and valued any ideas that would also be beneficial for the people they helped. Based on this insight, we developed a mapping system called Inact that could be used by organizations in conjunction with events such as community networking nights. During an event, Inact maps are hung up, creating space for people (both those working at community organizations and those visiting) to tell their life story and connect with others. At the end of an event, separate "feedback maps" allow attendees to record feedback about their experience at the event. This information is accessible by those who work at the organization, allowing them to better understand who is attending events and providing actionable data on how various events and initiatives within the organization are impacting the community.
