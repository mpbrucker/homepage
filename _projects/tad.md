## Provocation

For Technology, Accessbility, and Design (TAD), I spent eight weeks on a team of three working with [Our Space, Our Place,](http://www.ourspaceourplace.org/) a Boston-area afterschool program for students who are blind or visually impaired. We were tasked with creating a STEM/robotics activity for the students as a supplement to the program's existing offerings. Through research and several co-design sessions, we designed a one-hour workshop incorporating several key design principles: **kit accessibility,** with a simple, intuitive kit design and instructions in order to make the workshop fully teachable by a facilitator who is blind; and **open-ended creativity,** in order to make the workshop engaging for a group of varied interests.
