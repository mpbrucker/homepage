## Provocation

How do we represent statistics about Olin? As part of Olin Snapshot, a Greenhouse project, I undertook the task of re-imagining statistics about Olin featured in marketing materials by making an infographic out of chocolate. Representing data with chocolate makes it more tangible, and more easily moldable, but also messier.

## Manufacturing

**Illustrator design → laser-cut positive → food-safe silicone mold → chocolate relief.** Tiny details in the design broke off easily when removing the chocolates from the mold; it took several iterations to create a design that was sturdy enough for details to remain.

Axes and labels were designed in Illustrator, cut out of vinyl, and arranged by hand.
