# About Me

I'm a technologist, designer, and education researcher, currently studying in Northwestern University's [Computer Science + Learning Sciences](https://csls.sesp.northwestern.edu/) PhD program.

My research uses qualitative methods to explore gender equity and engineering/institutional culture through the narratives of engineering students. My Olin research group presented our work at the [IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8658912) in 2018.

I studied Computer Science at [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu/), where I helped found The Greenhouse, an in-house "institutional design studio" that experimented with institutional culture and held [some events.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/us/olin-college-fauxmencement-coronavirus-trnd/index.html) For my senior capstone design work, I helped pilot a program for affordable air quality home interventions in East Boston as part of [AirPartners](http://airpartners.org).
