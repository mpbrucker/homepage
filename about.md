# About Me

I'm a technologist, designer, and education researcher who attended [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu/). My work encompasses web tech, visual and human-centered design, and art, exploring institutional culture, collaboration, and tech. Much of my work has been with The Greenhouse, an in-house "institutional design studio" I helped found at Olin. I've also done various design projects in co-design with various communities in the Boston area, including my senior capstone design work as part of [AirPartners](http://airpartners.org).

My research uses qualitative methods to explore gender equity and engineering/institutional culture through the narratives of students in engineering education. We presented our work at the [IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8658912) in 2018.
